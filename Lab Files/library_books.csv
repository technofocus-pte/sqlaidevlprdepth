9,Advances in Endocrinology Research Volume 2,Dr. John P Monson,Endocrinology,2011,"Such is the importance of specific imaging modalities in the diagnosis of endocrine disease that the young endocrinologist of today may have difficulty envisaging an era prior to computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Imaging of the abdomen took a major leap forward with the development of precise ultrasound techniques over 30 years ago. Taking one example, prior to the advent of ultrasound, imaging of the adrenal glands depended on achieving X-ray contrast by the technique of peri-renal air insufflation, an uncomfortable and imprecise procedure. The diagnosis of pituitary lesions was equally difficult and depended on air encephalography, supported by plain X-ray polytomography. Much changed with the advent of CT imaging in the early 1970s; the earliest models were inadequate for anything other than large pituitary lesions but proved very useful in the definition of adrenal pathology. Precise imaging of intra-abdominal neuroendocrine malignancy awaited higher resolution CT imaging and awareness of the importance of arterial phase contrast imaging for the detection of hepatic neuroendocrine metastases. Lung windowed, thin section CT scanning remains the imaging modality of choice for the identification of pulmonary lesions including small bronchial carcinoid tumours.3
MRI, with increasing precision and speed of image acquisition, has revolutionised endocrine imaging. In relation to the pituitary, MRI permitted more precise definition of parasellar structures and small intrasellar pituitary adenomas.4It also proved invaluable in the evaluation of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours and the identification of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma. One of its major strengths was in permitting long-term repeated surveillance observation without radiation risk. This latter benefit has been a major determinant of the current conservative approach to residual pituitary tumour following incomplete surgical resection.
The precision of anatomical imaging now possible has resulted in the frequent identification of incidental lesions. Some (eg adrenal lesions) are of uncertain significance but may result in unforeseen investigation requirements and increased patient anxiety. We should therefore acknowledge that, in some instances, the sophistication of imaging techniques now exceeds our understanding of the natural history of some disorders.
Another important point, emerging clearly in endocrine practice, is that cross-sectional imaging techniques do not confirm pathology, but rather serve to localise an established diagnosis. Indeed, the early application of imaging for a diagnosis which is suspected but not confirmed may prove seriously misleading, not least because of the high prevalence of incidental non-functioning, benign lesions in the adrenal, thyroid and pituitary.
The ability to add a functional element to an imaging study has been a further important advance achieved by application of angiography techniques and selective venous sampling. Examples include selective arterial calcium stimulation with hepatic venous sampling for the investigation of islet cell tumours, selective venous sampling for adrenal and parathyroid lesions and bilateral, simultaneous petrosal sinus sampling for the confirmation of adrenocorti-cotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's disease.5
In parallel with advances in cross-sectional imaging techniques there has been increased sophistication in the application of nuclear medicine techniques for diagnosis and therapy. Isotope technology has longstanding proven value in the investigation and treatment of thyroid disease but more recent developments have included labelled MIBI parathyroid scanning, labelled octreotide scanning for neuroendocrine tumours and iodine-123 and I-131 labelled MIBG imaging and therapy for phaeochromocytoma and metastatic neuroendocrine tumours.6"

31,Advances in Neurology Research IAN Book ,Shakir,Neurology,2019,"This is a book of plenty, yet it is concise enough for all to enjoy. The editors state, “ The book is an important addition to already existing books on Neurology.” I would like to disagree, in my opinion it is unique. It crosses the gulf between standard textbook, clinical instructions, management guides with detailed correlative anatomy, functional neurology, and therapeutics.

There is an enormous amount of information, which is enough for any neurologist albeit in training and in practice or those working in research institutions. The chapters are not only written by experienced clinicians but also academics rooted in practice. The guidelines are precise and detailed.

The 207 authors managed to write 111 chapters, which are rich and by and large uniform. They vary from classical sections such as headache, stroke, epilepsy, movement disorders, and dementia. It is in contrast to a futuristic chapter on Robotics in neurology. This is, in essence, the idea of the book, which is probably the thinking of the IAN to mix history, current practice, research, and future developments.

There are too many gem chapters that attract attention. Some of the unorthodox ones include the one on “Pitfalls in the diagnosis of demyelinating disease.” This chapter follows exquisite chapters on all aspects of demyelination. Readers are reminded of the myriad of disorders, which mimic demyelinating disorders."

In recent years, endocrinology has expanded to include a broader range of human experiences, such as aging and longevity, gender identity, and transplantation. These developments have been made possible by interdisciplinary research in endocrinology. Molecular modeling has led to the development of novel medications, and stem cell research has opened  new avenues for treating previously incurable endocrine diseases, such as diabetes. However, these advances have also given rise to new ethical dilemmas that require interdisciplinary research to resolve. For example, medical ethicists, philosophers, and religious authorities are engaged in heated debates regarding the use of stem cells and the potential risks associated with dismantling the human embryo, which many consider to be the alteration of human life. This book addresses some of these challenges, caused by recent advances in the biology and medicine, and hopes to shed light on their impact in the field of endocrinology.

76,Advances in Cardiology Research Volume 1,Dr. Meera Iyer,Cardiology,2013,"Cardiology, the study and treatment of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, represents a convergence of art and science, blending rigorous scientific inquiry with compassionate patient care. From the intricacies of cardiac anatomy and physiology to the delicate balance of hemodynamics and electrophysiology, the field encompasses a vast array of disciplines, each contributing to our understanding of cardiovascular health and disease. One of the most remarkable aspects of cardiology is its ability to adapt and evolve in response to new challenges and discoveries. Over the past few decades, we've witnessed a revolution in our understanding of cardiovascular disease, fueled by advances in genetics, imaging, biomarker testing, and therapeutics. From the elucidation of the genetic underpinnings of inherited cardiac conditions to the development of novel imaging modalities such as cardiac MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and CT (Computed Tomography) angiography, these technological innovations have transformed the practice of cardiology, enabling earlier detection, more accurate diagnosis, and personalized treatment approaches.

Despite these remarkable advances, cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for continued vigilance and innovation in the field of cardiology. From the rising tide of obesity and diabetes to the global epidemic of hypertension and atherosclerosis, the burden of cardiovascular disease is staggering, affecting individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and socioeconomic statuses.

One of the greatest challenges facing cardiology today is the growing epidemic of lifestyle related risk factors such as poor diet, sedentary behavior, tobacco use, and excessive alcohol consumption. These modifiable risk factors contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease, placing an enormous burden on healthcare systems and economies worldwide. As healthcare providers, it is incumbent upon us to educate our patients about the importance of healthy lifestyle choices and empower them to take control of their cardiovascular health through diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and stress management.

Another pressing issue in cardiology is the rising prevalence of heart disease in low and middle income countries, where access to healthcare services and preventive interventions may be limited. In these settings, disparities in cardiovascular care contribute to higher rates of morbidity and mortality from conditions such as rheumatic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and ischemic heart disease. In the scope of cardiovascular research, collaboration and innovation are key to unlocking new insights into the pathophysiology of heart disease and developing novel therapeutic strategies. From basic science discoveries to translational research efforts to large-scale clinical trials, every stage of the research continuum has a main role in advancing our understanding of cardiovascular disease and improving patient outcomes.

The future of cardiology has both potential and uncertainty. Rapid advances in technology, such as artificial intelligence, telemedicine, and wearable devices that revolutionize the delivery of cardiovascular care, offering new opportunities for remote monitoring, early intervention, and personalized medicine. However, these technological advancements also raise ethical and practical considerations, including data privacy, algorithm bias, and healthcare disparities, that must be addressed to ensure equitable access to high-quality care for all patients."

98,Advances in Psychiatry Research Volume 1,Dr. Suresh Iyer,Psychiatry,2018,"The scenario of mental health in India has undergone tremendous changes and radical paradigm shifts, over the past 50 years. The proliferation of general hospital psychiatry units, which was instrumental in extending the mental health services beyond the realms of asylums and mental hospitals, the surge of psychopharmacological and biological therapies, which galvanized treatment strategies, and greatly improved outcomes, and the National Mental Health Program as a part of the National Health Policy are few milestones, in the nation's journey toward mental health. “Developments in Psychiatry in India: Clinical, Research and Policy Perspective” attempts to chart the course of evolution and advances in clinical services, research endeavors and policy issues, pertaining to psychiatry in postindependence India.

The editors of this book are pioneer psychiatrists of international repute, who have made path-breaking contributions to the field of psychiatry in India. It consists of 32 chapters, which have been authored by stalwarts in the specific fields of psychiatry in India. Sections in the book include History of Psychiatry in India, and specific parts elaborating the Developments in Psychology and Psychodynamics, General Adult Psychiatry, Child Psychiatry, Substance Use Psychiatry, Community Psychiatry, Liaison Psychiatry, Other Psychiatric Specialities, Treatment, and Legal and Educational Aspects.

The book begins with a brief historical overview of the Indian scenario of psychiatry during the preindependence era, with subsequent developments over the next 50 years. It is followed by a comprehensive section on the developments in the field of psychology and psychodynamics. It explores the journey of evolving psychometric tests in India, the painstaking efforts made by reputed researchers to develop them, and the limitations in the clinical utility of psychometric tests in the Indian population. A separate chapter deals with reflections on cultural psychodynamics in the context of Indian traditions, cultural beliefs, and nuances. An insightful description of the Indian psyche of the “Indian personality” and its characteristics in contrast with the industrialized societies of the west provides a clear picture of transcultural issues from an Indian perspective.

The book briefly describes the controversies and challenges surrounding psychiatric nosology and goes on to mention the Indian contributions and issues in this area. Similarly research and advances in specific fields, e.g. general adult psychiatry, child psychiatry, addiction psychiatry and speciality branches such as geriatric psychiatry are comprehensively described. The emergence of branches like psycho-oncology and India's contribution to delirium research has been illustrated in a section on liaison psychiatry. Indian research in the area of developing treatment modalities such as newer somatic treatments, psychosocial interventions, and rehabilitation have been delineated in separate chapters. The educational aspects reflected through challenges in psychiatric training have also received focus in a chapter on undergraduate psychiatric training in India. The last chapter focuses on the legal framework with respect to psychiatry, legislative and implementation issues concerning the existing Mental Health Act, and recent developments to address these lacunas."
99,Advances in Endocrinology Research Volume 4,Dr. Hossein Gharib,Endocrinology,2014,"The field of endocrinology is concerned with the hormonal mechanisms that regulate many bodily functions, including metabolism, growth, reproduction, electrolytes and water balance. In recent years, endocrinology has expanded to include a broader range of human experiences, such as aging and longevity, gender identity, and transplantation. These developments have been made possible by interdisciplinary research in endocrinology. Molecular modeling has led to the development of novel medications, and stem cell research has opened  new avenues for treating previously incurable endocrine diseases, such as diabetes. However, these advances have also given rise to new ethical dilemmas that require interdisciplinary research to resolve. For example, medical ethicists, philosophers, and religious authorities are engaged in heated debates regarding the use of stem cells and the potential risks associated with dismantling the human embryo, which many consider to be the alteration of human life.

Methods:
For this narrative review, we examined information from the published literature, along with key documents from the Indian Psychiatric Society, the National Medical Commission, and other relevant sources.
Conclusions:
In India, psychiatry training has seen significant advancements since independence, particularly in the past decade, driven by the recommendations of the Indian Psychiatric Society and the introduction of competency-based medical education by the National Medical Commission. This transformation has redefined undergraduate and postgraduate training across all medical disciplines, including psychiatry. The shift has moved away from traditional, time-bound frameworks toward a focus on acquiring specific competencies essential for effective clinical practice. This approach ensures that trainees gain theoretical knowledge and develop practical skills and professional attitudes crucial for patient care. However, a major challenge highlighted in this review is the transition of senior residents to faculty roles without adequate training in teaching, research, academia, and leadership. Despite this, they are expected to excel in these areas upon assuming faculty positions. To address this gap, we emphasize the urgent need for a comprehensive faculty development program for early career faculty. Our proposed initiative aims to bridge these gaps and support the development of future leaders and educators in psychiatry. The recommendations outlined in this review seek to create a robust educational environment that will cultivate the next generation of psychiatrists in India."

The chapters provide the latest information on innovative technologies used in the treatment of paediatric endocrine disorders. Written by the very experts leading these advances, it is of immense interest to paediatric endocrinologists and endocrinologists wanting to stay abreast of the developments, many of which are likely to emerge as future therapies.

The future of therapy for type 1 diabetes lies in the development of an ?artificial pancreas? that would act as a glucose sensor and insulin pump simultaneously. The chapter on the automation of insulin delivery devices discusses advances in the development of closed loop insulin delivery systems. Other future therapies, including islet cell transplantation, and the current status and indications both of autotransplantation (carried out after pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis) and allotransplantation in type 1 diabetes, are discussed in detail.

Childhood obesity is a challenging disorder to treat and is often refractory to lifestyle modification, diet and drugs. However, the emergence of new pharmacotherapy may change this situation by giving us hope of an effective therapeutic option. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have been widely used in adults with type 2 diabetes and have been found to be effective in causing weight loss among obese patients. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the treatment of adolescent obesity with GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, have shown promising results and the book covers the literature and mechanism of action of exenatide in detail. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a complication of obesity, for which there is no effective therapy currently. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid, is emerging as a potential therapy for this condition. It is postulated to have anti-inflammatory effects and insulin-sensitizing properties through its action on G-protein-complex receptor 120 (GPR-120), which is expressed in hepatic macrophages. In randomized trials of paediatric NAFLD, docosahexaenoic acid improved insulin resistance, and decreased serum triglyceride levels and hepatic steatosis."
151,Advances in Oncology Research Volume 5,Dr. Suresh Iyer,Oncology,2017,"This book concisely reviews important advances in radiation oncology, providing practicing radiation oncologists with a fundamental understanding of each topic and an appreciation of its significance for the future of radiation oncology. It explores in detail the impact of newer imaging modalities, such as multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and other novel agents, which deliver improved visualization of the physiologic and phenotypic features of a given cancer, helping oncologists to provide more targeted radiotherapy and assess the response. Due consideration is also given to how advanced technologies for radiation therapy delivery have created new treatment options for patients with localized and metastatic disease, highlighting the increasingly important role of image-guided radiotherapy in treating systemic and oligometastatic disease. Further topics include the potential value of radiotherapy in enhancing immunotherapy thanks to the broader immune-stimulatory effects,  how cancer stem cells and the tumor microenvironment influence response, and the application of mathematical and systems biology methods to radiotherapy.

152,Advances in Cardiology Research Volume 3,Dr. Rahul Patel,Cardiology,2023,"In the last 50 years, vast prevention and treatment strides for cardiovascular disease have brought new possibilities. But cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death worldwide, cautions Bernard J. Gersh, M.B., Ch.B., D.Phil., consultant in Cardiovascular Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and an emeritus professor of medicine and cardiology at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science.

The future looks different.

The cardiovascular expert sees positive change ahead with novel advances for patient care. Here, Dr. Gersh delves into the developments set to transform cardiovascular medicine and bring better outcomes for more patients.

New prevention and risk stratification approaches
We've had huge advances in predicting who is at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. The next 10 to 20 years will be dominated by primary, secondary and primordial prevention. This is because we now have innovative approaches to risk stratification using genetics, sophisticated imaging, scans and other modalities that use artificial intelligence (AI). For example, with some imaging techniques we can look at inflammation in the arterial wall, which we couldn't do 5 to 10 years ago. What this means for prevention is we'll increasingly be able to identify people at high risk earlier and more precisely.

With these risk-stratifying tools of imaging, AI and genetics, there's potential for people to know their risk of heart disease before symptoms appear. We're going to see polygenic risk scores for cardiovascular disease. Polygenic risk scores are tools developed by scientists that analyze multiple genetic variants across a person's genome. They help access the likelihood of developing a condition. In the future, experts could potentially use the risk scores to customize prevention and treatment strategies and improve diagnosis.

RNA-targeted therapies
There will be a shift from traditional pharmacological approaches to using RNA-targeted technology. The RNA-targeted therapeutics are unequivocally going to play a prominent if not a revolutionary role in the near future. Rather than just lower cholesterol, the therapeutics will treat biological systems underpinning disease entities. With these more-precise RNA-targeted therapeutics, we can get into the biological system that causes higher cholesterol, hypertension and other conditions. We're on the cusp of some of these advances already in the clinical arena.

Dramatic lipid lowering. Why is cardiovascular disease still the leading cause of death worldwide? Human beings have high lipid levels and become hyperlipidemic. But we're getting close to therapies that can lower serum cholesterol levels to unprecedented levels. The clinical trials are ongoing right now, and for some of these new drugs we already know how much they can lower cholesterol. We're waiting another year or two to see whether the results show a striking reduction in cardiac events, and that will be the last piece of the puzzle.
Treating hypertension. We can also use RNA technology to develop targeted therapeutic agents for hypertension, and several new antihypertensive agents are currently undergoing clinical trials. Hypertension is extremely common in the United States and around the world. Many Americans with hypertension don't take their medications. The new drug may only need to be given twice a year.
Complex interventions
We'll see a profound impact on percutaneous structural interventions on the prognosis of valvular heart disease, especially the tricuspid valve. Technology advances such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and angioplasty will continue. TAVR is the first step in what will evolve over the next decades. We've moved from the aortic valve to the more complicated mitral valve. We now have percutaneous treatments for mitral valve regurgitation.

The next fruit on the tree is the tricuspid valve. This is much more complex. But tricuspid valve replacements are already being tested in clinical trials, and some have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. We will see earlier intervention for the unnatural history of the disease with improved outcomes. It won't prevent tricuspid and aortic mitral valve disease, but it will change the course of the disease for the better.

Gene modification
Researchers can understand the genetics of disease by studying the effects of DNA variants between people. The CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein) system is a widely used gene-editing tool. It allows researchers to precisely change the sequence of a genome and study the effects on cellular function.

The role of CRISPR-Cas9 editing is significant to stop disease before it starts, or in some patients, modify disease already present. This technology suggests that in diseases that have a genetic etiology, there is potential to modify that gene in utero or early in life. For example, if a person is born with the gene for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, it may take 10 years for the disease to clinically manifest. But specialists can prevent the disease by altering the gene. Clinical trials are in progress. We have a long way to go, but this is part of the future."

173,Advances in Endocrinology Research Volume 4,Dr. Hossein Gharib ,Endocrinology,2016,"The field of endocrinology is concerned with the hormonal mechanisms that regulate many bodily functions, including metabolism, growth, reproduction, electrolytes and water balance. In recent years, endocrinology has expanded to include a broader range of human experiences, such as aging and longevity, gender identity, and transplantation. These developments have been made possible by interdisciplinary research in endocrinology. Molecular modeling has led to the development of novel medications, and stem cell research has opened  new avenues for treating previously incurable endocrine diseases, such as diabetes. However, these advances have also given rise to new ethical dilemmas that require interdisciplinary research to resolve. For example, medical ethicists, philosophers, and religious authorities are engaged in heated debates regarding the use of stem cells and the potential risks associated with dismantling the human embryo, which many consider to be the alteration of human life. This book addresses some of these challenges, caused by recent advances in the biology and medicine, and hopes to shed light on their impact in the field of endocrinology."
